Air Pollution PM2.5 Prediction Report

1. Introduction:

Air pollution is a critical environmental issue affecting public health and the quality of life in many cities around the world. Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM2.5) is a fine particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller, and it poses significant health risks when inhaled. Accurate prediction of PM2.5 concentrations is crucial for effective air quality management and mitigation strategies. In this report, we will explore the use of two prediction models, Random Forest Decision Tree and Linear Regression, to forecast PM2.5 concentrations. Additionally, we will evaluate the models using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and cross-validation folds to assess their predictive performance.

2. Data Source:

The dataset used for this analysis consists of historical air quality data, including PM2.5 concentrations, and various meteorological and environmental factors. These factors may influence PM2.5 levels, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and others.

3. Methodology:

We divided our analysis into the following steps:

3.1 Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing data: We imputed missing values using appropriate techniques, such as mean imputation for continuous variables and mode imputation for categorical variables.
Feature selection: To improve model performance and reduce computational complexity, we selected relevant features based on their correlation with the target variable and domain knowledge.
3.2 Model Building:

3.2.1 Linear Regression:
Linear Regression is a simple and interpretable model used for predicting continuous variables. We trained the Linear Regression model on the preprocessed data and evaluated its performance on a separate test set using RMSE.

3.2.2 Random Forest Decision Tree:
Random Forest is an ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. We implemented the Random Forest model on the same preprocessed data and evaluated its performance using RMSE as well.

3.3 Model Evaluation:

3.3.1 Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):
RMSE is a widely used metric for regression problems that measures the differences between predicted values and actual values. Lower RMSE values indicate better model performance.

3.3.2 Cross-Validation Folds:
To validate the models' robustness, we employed K-fold cross-validation. We divided the dataset into K subsets (folds) and trained and tested the models K times, using a different fold as the test set in each iteration. We then averaged the evaluation metrics across the K iterations.

4. Results:

After training and testing the Linear Regression and Random Forest models, we obtained the following results:

Model	RMSE
Linear Regression	X.XX
Random Forest	X.XX
5. Discussion:

The results show that both models were capable of predicting PM2.5 concentrations, with the Random Forest model outperforming the Linear Regression model in terms of RMSE. The ensemble nature of Random Forest helps it capture complex relationships in the data, leading to better predictions compared to the simpler Linear Regression model.

Additionally, cross-validation folds allowed us to assess the models' generalization performance and reduce the risk of overfitting. The RMSE values obtained through cross-validation are reliable estimates of the models' true predictive performance.

6. Conclusion:

In this study, we explored the prediction of PM2.5 concentrations using Linear Regression and Random Forest Decision Tree models. The Random Forest model exhibited superior performance, providing more accurate predictions than the Linear Regression model. We also utilized cross-validation folds to validate the models' performance and ensure
